# Installation and configuration

## Install the gem

Add LesliTesting to the test group of a Rails application, Rails engine, or Ruby gem:

```shell
bundle add lesli_testing --group test
```

The equivalent `Gemfile` entry is:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem "lesli_testing"
end
```

When the dependency is declared in a gemspec, keep it as a development dependency because applications using the released gem do not need LesliTesting at runtime:

```ruby
spec.add_development_dependency "lesli_testing"
```

For local development inside a Lesli workspace, point Bundler to the checkout:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem "lesli_testing", path: "gems/LesliTesting"
end
```

Then install the dependencies:

```shell
bundle install
```

## Select a project profile

Require LesliTesting in `test/test_helper.rb` and call one configuration method:

```ruby
require "lesli_testing"

LesliTesting.app("LesliBuilder")
```

Available methods are:

| Method | Intended project | Coverage profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LesliTesting.app(name, options = {})` | Rails application | Tracks Ruby files in `app`, `lib`, `engines`, and `gems`. |
| `LesliTesting.engine(name, options = {})` | Rails engine | Uses the Rails profile and filters test files. |
| `LesliTesting.gem(name, options = {})` | Standalone Ruby gem | Tracks the standard `app` and `lib` paths and filters test files. |

Do not call more than one profile method in the same test process. All three methods configure the same global Minitest and SimpleCov instances.

## Configuration options

Pass options as keyword-style hash entries:

```ruby
LesliTesting.engine(
  "LesliShield",
  coverage_missing_len: 30,
  coverage_min_coverage: 80
)
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `coverage_missing_len` | Integer | `25` | Maximum number of characters displayed for missing lines in console coverage output. Use `0` for no limit. |
| `coverage_min_coverage` | Numeric | `90` | Minimum required line-coverage percentage. A coverage run fails below this value. |

The selected project profile is set internally. Applications should not pass `coverage_profile` directly.

## Load order

Coverage must start before the files being measured are required. Put the LesliTesting configuration as early as the test environment permits:

```ruby
require "lesli_testing"
LesliTesting.gem("MyGem")

require "minitest/autorun"
require "my_gem"
```

Rails-only base classes are created when the corresponding Rails test classes already exist. If a suite uses `LesliTesting::IntegrationTester`, `LesliTesting::ModelTester`, or `LesliTesting::ViewTester`, load the Rails environment and `rails/test_help` before configuring LesliTesting:

```ruby
ENV["RAILS_ENV"] ||= "test"
require_relative "../config/environment"
require "rails/test_help"

require "lesli_testing"
LesliTesting.app("MyApplication")
```

Rails autoloading means application models and controllers can still be covered when they are first referenced by tests. Code eagerly loaded before LesliTesting starts is not included in that process's coverage measurement.
