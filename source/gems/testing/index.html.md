## Introduction

LesliTesting provides the shared test configuration used across the [Lesli Framework](https://github.com/LesliTech/Lesli).

It standardizes Minitest output, SimpleCov profiles, coverage reports, and fixture loading for Rails applications, engines, and Ruby gems.

<br />

## Features

- Coverage profiles for Rails applications, Rails engines, and Ruby gems
- A human-friendly Minitest reporter with per-test timing and failure details
- SimpleCov HTML, console, and Cobertura reports
- Configurable minimum coverage thresholds
- Shared base classes for integration, model, and view tests
- Automatic access to Lesli fixtures in Rails test cases

<br />

## Quick Start

Add LesliTesting to the test group:

```shell
bundle add lesli_testing --group test
```

Require the gem from `test/test_helper.rb` and select exactly one profile for the project:

```ruby
require "lesli_testing"

LesliTesting.app("LesliBuilder")       # Rails application
# LesliTesting.engine("LesliShield")  # Rails engine
# LesliTesting.gem("LesliDate")       # Standalone Ruby gem
```

Load LesliTesting before the code under test when coverage is enabled. Rails projects should load `rails/test_help` before configuration when they use the shared Rails test classes.

Run the suite normally or enable coverage with `COVERAGE`:

```shell
bin/rails test
COVERAGE=true bin/rails test

bundle exec rake
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rake
```

Set `QUIET=true` to hide individual passing-test lines while retaining the summary and failure details.

<br />

## Development

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LesliTech/LesliTesting.git
cd LesliTesting
bundle install
```

To use local source from a Lesli development workspace, reference it from the host application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "lesli_testing", path: "gems/LesliTesting"
```

### Tests

Run the default test task from the LesliTesting directory:

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

Run the reporter demonstration failures explicitly with `DEMO=true`:

```shell
DEMO=true bundle exec ruby -Itest test/demo_test.rb
```

The demo command is expected to fail and is intended for visually checking failure formatting.
