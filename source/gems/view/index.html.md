## Introduction

LesliView is the official user-interface library for the [Lesli Framework](https://github.com/LesliTech/Lesli). It packages the framework's shared interface patterns as ViewComponent-powered components, Rails form builders, and domain-oriented views.

Use LesliView to build consistent server-rendered interfaces without recreating common layouts, controls, forms, and application states in every Lesli engine.

<br />

## Why LesliView?

LesliView provides:

- A shared visual language across Lesli applications and engines
- Composable, testable components built with ViewComponent
- Rails-native form builders with consistent labels, controls, messages, and actions
- Reusable views for common product concepts such as activities, attachments, discussions, and tasks
- Responsive presentation based on Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Accessible defaults for labels, button states, navigation, and page actions

<br />

## Quick Start

### Requirements

The current development baseline is:

- Ruby 3.2 or newer
- Rails 8.1
- LesliAssets, configured in the host application's asset build

ViewComponent and Lexxy are installed as runtime dependencies of LesliView.

### Install with Lesli

LesliView and LesliAssets are installed automatically with the main `lesli` gem. No additional gem or asset configuration is required in a standard Lesli application.

### Install in another Rails application

Add LesliView to the application:

```shell
bundle add lesli_view
```

For the complete Lesli presentation layer, also install the shared assets package:

```shell
bundle add lesli_assets
```

The host application must configure LesliAssets in its asset build so the Lesli styles and icon fonts are available before rendering the components.

<br />

## Usage

### Build a page header

Compose a layout and header directly from an ERB template:

```erb
<%= render LesliView::Layout::Container.new("tickets") do %>
    <%= render LesliView::Components::Header.new(
        "Tickets",
        "Manage customer requests and follow-up work.",
        new_path: new_ticket_path,
        new_label: "Create ticket"
    ) %>
<% end %>
```

### Render an action

Elements provide focused interface primitives with consistent behavior and styling:

```erb
<%= render LesliView::Elements::Button.new(
    "Create ticket",
    icon: "add",
    url: new_ticket_path
) %>
```

### Build a form

Pass the LesliView builder to the standard Rails form helpers:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @ticket, builder: LesliView::Forms::Builder) do |form| %>
    <%= form.field_control_text :subject %>
    <%= form.field_control_textarea :description %>
    <%= form.field_control_submit "Save ticket" %>
<% end %>
```

<br />

## Library

LesliView organizes its public interface into focused groups:

| Group | Included building blocks |
| --- | --- |
| Charts | Bar, line, and general chart rendering |
| Components | Headers, panels, tabs, timelines, and toolbars |
| Elements | Avatars, buttons, empty states, and tables |
| Forms | Standard and horizontal builders, fields, inputs, and fieldsets |
| Items | Actions, activities, attachments, discussions, and tasks |
| Layouts | Shared application containers |
| Partials | Reusable engine information |
| Widgets | Calendars, charts, counters, dates, and weather |

See the [LesliView documentation](https://www.lesli.dev/gems/view/) for component options and additional examples.

<br />

## Development

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LesliTech/LesliView.git
cd LesliView
bundle install
```

Run the default test suite:

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

To develop LesliView inside a local Lesli workspace, reference the repository from the host application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "lesli_view", path: "gems/LesliView"
```

Then run `bundle install` from the host application so changes to the local gem are loaded immediately.
