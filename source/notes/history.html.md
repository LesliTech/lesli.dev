# The Journey of Lesli

Lesli as concept was created back in 2014, the first commit of Lesli was as a private WordPress plugin created to provide a small administration software for companies that the only software they had was a website installed in a shared hosting running PHP 5 and MySQL.

With the time Lesli was growing in features and evolve to a completely stand a alone software, built-on top of Slim PHP for the backend and mustache + and (an early 0.9 version of) Vuejs for the web application, providing a more robust web software, but more important, compatible with all the shared hosting providers, so my users didn't have to worry about complex virtual servers to run the software that they need to manage their small businesses.

2018 was the year I first try to migrate the base code to something that allows me to introduce custom requirements from customers that were allowed to pay for them (not just a small monthly fee) so the first migration of Lesli happens, Nodejs for the new shiny modular backend, MongoDB for the super scalable database and Vuejs for the incredible web user interface.

Just one year later in 2019 I was introduced to Ruby on Rails, as you can see now, I totally fell in love, so I dropped a really lot of work and started to migrate the core of Lesli now Using Rails 5; Just few months later I had a totally working version of Lesi.

Remember this was a private software? in 2019 I start working with an investor from the other side of the world, the idea was to create a product that is easy to distribute, install, maintain and secure enough to leverage the operations of big companies.

That didnt went to well, but at least, I was able to design the first version of Lesli as a framework.

So after 5 years leading a big groups of developers and working trying to acomplish the (selfish maybe) desires of my associates, I decided to step out and continue working in Lesli by my own.

In 2024 I decided to go back to my roots and release Lesli as open source software (under the GPLv3) with the hope of create something that is useful for people and maybe help others to grow their business providing a solid and well created software.
