# Analytics

LesliAudit Analytics describes how authenticated users use the application.
It combines request counters with the browser, operating-system, and device
categories observed after successful authentication. These reports are
operational analytics; they are not an audit trail and do not measure anonymous
website visits.

Authenticated controllers inheriting from `Lesli::ApplicationLesliController`
send the current user, controller, action, and optional session to
`LesliAudit::LoggerInterface#log_requests` through an `after_action` callback.
Request data is written synchronously and remains scoped to the current
account.

## Request Capture

1. When analytics is enabled, `AccountRequest` increments the counter matching
   the current date, controller, and action.
2. When a session is available, `UserRequest` increments the corresponding
   per-user counter.
3. When journals are enabled, `UserJournal` records the individual request.

Device capture is intentionally separate. The authentication flow calls
`log_devices` only after a successful login.

## Request Records Are Different

| Record | Meaning | Typical question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AccountRequest` | Grouped counter by account, date, controller, and action | How many authenticated requests reached each application endpoint? |
| `UserRequest` | Grouped counter by user, optional session, date, controller, and action | How many matching requests did this user make? |
| `UserJournal` | One normalized record for an individual captured request | When did this user's individual requests occur? |
| `UserLog` | Explicit append-only business or security event | Which auditable operation did this user perform? |

`AccountRequest` powers account-level Analytics totals and trends. It does not
identify the users responsible for those requests.

`UserRequest#request_count` increases when matching requests are captured.
It is compact reporting data and does not retain every request timestamp.

`UserJournal` is detailed operational history. Its `created_at` supports
first/last activity calculations. A journal is not audit evidence: it proves
that an HTTP request was observed, not that a business change succeeded.

`UserLog` is written separately by application code that knows the business
meaning and outcome. Do not infer a `UserLog` from the presence of either
request record.

## Reports

With the engine mounted at `/audit`, the current interface exposes:

| Route | Data source | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/audit/analytics` | Authenticated request and successful-login agent aggregates | Current tenant |
| `/audit/users` | Core user status, registrations, and retained-journal working hours | Current tenant; access controlled by LesliShield role privileges |
| `/audit/requests` | `UserRequest` aggregates | Current tenant for owners and administrators; current user for other authorized roles |

### Requests access and query behavior

LesliShield permissions determine whether a user may open `/audit/requests`.
Once access is granted, the built-in `owner` and `admin` roles receive the
account-wide reporting scope. Other authorized roles receive only records
belonging to the current user. The neutral **Requests** name reflects both
possible scopes.

Every scope starts from `current_user.account.audit.user_requests`; changing a
filter, sort column, page, or role can never include another account. Search
matches user email, controller, or action. Sorting is restricted to the visible
columns, page numbers are normalized, and page size is capped at 100 records.

Device and browser figures count successful logins by normalized agent
category. They are not unique people or physical devices. Device capture is
invoked explicitly by the authentication flow and never by `log_requests`.

The Users report deliberately excludes these account request trends and login-agent
distributions. See [Users](/engines/audit/users/overview) for its person-centered
scope and retained-journal working-hours semantics.

## Production Cache

The complete Analytics dashboard is cached for one hour in production. Cache
keys include the Audit account, selected period, and current date, so cached
data cannot cross tenant boundaries or carry a daily report across midnight.

Caching is disabled in development, test, and every environment other than
production. Those environments always execute the Analytics queries directly
against the database.

See [Configuration](/engines/audit/about/configuration) for capture modes,
[Database](/engines/audit/about/database#choosing-the-correct-record) for table
semantics, and [Architecture and Data Policy](/engines/audit/about/architecture)
for privacy and retention guarantees.

Resources served from a CDN use the separate provider-import workflow described
in [Traffic](/engines/audit/traffic/overview).
