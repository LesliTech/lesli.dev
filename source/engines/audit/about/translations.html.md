# Translations

LesliAudit reserves the `lesli_audit` namespace for all user-facing labels. Locale files live in `config/locales/translations.<locale>.yml`; the engine currently provides files for English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese.

New labels should follow the standard engine, bucket, and label structure:

```yaml
en:
  lesli_audit:
    users:
      title: "Users"
      no_activity: "No retained user activity was found"
    shared:
      requests: "Requests"
```

Use the complete key from Ruby or ERB:

```erb
<%= I18n.t("lesli_audit.users.title") %>
```

The shipped locale files contain the current interface vocabulary. Add every
new key to each supported locale, replace the corresponding hard-coded text,
and preserve interpolation variables between languages.

Navigation labels remain single words and use this fixed conceptual order:
Users, Analytics, Traffic, Requests, and Logs. Translate the words naturally,
but do not merge concepts or replace Traffic with an Analytics label.

When LesliBabel is installed, synchronize the local files with:

```shell
bin/rails lesli_babel:scan
bin/rails lesli_babel:import
```

The files in LesliAudit remain the version-controlled source shipped with the gem. Review any Babel-generated changes before committing them.

See the [engine documentation standard](/engines/lesli/contributing/engines) for namespace and bucket conventions.
