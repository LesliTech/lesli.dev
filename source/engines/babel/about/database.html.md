# Database

LesliBabel uses collection code `09` and engine code `01`. It stores translation structure in three tables:

| Migration code | Table | Responsibility | Important relationships |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `09.01.10.01.10` | `lesli_babel_modules` | Installed engine or application namespaces | Parent of buckets |
| `09.01.11.01.10` | `lesli_babel_buckets` | Controller or feature groups inside a module | Belongs to a module |
| `09.01.12.01.10` | `lesli_babel_labels` | Translation keys, locale values, and translation state | Belongs to a bucket |

Modules, buckets, and labels support soft deletion through `deleted_at`. Labels contain a column for each supported locale and metadata used to track translation state and references.

The ownership hierarchy is:

```text
lesli_babel_modules
└── lesli_babel_buckets
    └── lesli_babel_labels
```

Changing the configured locale set can require both application configuration and schema support. Verify the label columns before enabling a new managed locale.

Prepare and inspect the schema through the host application:

```shell
bin/rails lesli:db:prepare
bin/rails db:migrate:status
```

See [Database Architecture](/engines/lesli/database/structure) and [Migration Versioning](/engines/lesli/database/versioning) for shared conventions.
