In the dynamic world of web development, creating multilingual applications is a necessity. To streamline the process of managing translations in Rails applications, we proudly introduce LesliBabel – a powerful and versatile module designed to simplify the complexities of handling multilingual content.


LesliBabel is a translation management module specifically crafted for the Lesli Framework but compatible with Ruby on Rails standard apps. It provides users with a robust set of tools to efficiently handle string translations across multiple languages.

**Multi-Language Support:**
Supporting a plethora of languages, LesliBabel allows developers to create applications that cater to a global audience. Easily add and update translations for different locales without breaking a sweat.

**String Modification and Addition:**
LesliBabel simplifies the process of modifying and adding new strings to your application. The module ensures that the translation workflow seamlessly integrates into your Rails development environment, providing a well designed structure to group translations by apps (rails engines), buckets (Controllers) and components (UI elements).

**Translation Workflow:**
LesliBabel comes equipped with a streamlined translation workflow. Developers can effortlessly translate strings, review pending translations, and ensure the accuracy of content across various languages.

### Modules

Modules has a single record for every engine you have installed in the host Rails app, this record acts as main owner of the all translations that belongs to this specific engine.

::: info
The host app is also considered as a module.

### Buckets

Buckets is a representation for every controller registered in the routes file of the engine. The following example represent two different buckets of strings inside LesliBabel:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
  resources :posts
end
```

Buckets basically acts as containers for all the translations that belongs to an app that works under an specific route.

</lesli-browser>

### Strings

Finally, this table has the strings that we are going to use into our application (we can use this strings into ruby or javascript code), inside lesli_babel_strings we can find a record for every strings we want to translate.

Example:

| string | en | es | it | fr |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| hello | Hello | Hola | Ciao | Bonjour |
| bye | Bye | Adios | Ciao | au revoir |

### The editor
LesliBabel includes a useful web editor, eliminating the need for technical skills to edit translations. This feature enables users to collaborate on translations effectively.

The translation editor offers a straightforward yet valuable interface, allowing you to easily check the status of all translations.

</lesli-browser>

You have the capability to expand each string container, providing you with a comprehensive view of the individual strings and their corresponding translations for every supported language. This feature allows for in-depth inspection and modification, empowering users to meticulously review and update translations in a user-friendly manner. The detailed view within the string container simplifies the translation management process.
