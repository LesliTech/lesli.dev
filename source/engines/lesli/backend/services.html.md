# Services

Lesli service objects keep account-scoped queries and business operations outside controllers. Framework services inherit from `Lesli::ApplicationLesliService`.

```ruby
module MyEngine
  class TicketService < Lesli::ApplicationLesliService
  end
end
```

Initialize a service with the current user and the normalized controller query:

```ruby
service = MyEngine::TicketService.new(current_user, query)
```

The base class stores `current_user`, `query`, a result resource, and a list of failures for the lifetime of the service instance.

---

## Account-scoped Queries

Build queries through the current user's account association. This preserves the tenant boundary in the service layer:

```ruby
def index
  current_user.account.my_engine.tickets
    .order(id: :desc)
    .page(query.dig(:pagination, :page))
    .per(query.dig(:pagination, :perPage))
end
```

Do not query an engine model globally when the resource belongs to an account. Controllers and route authorization do not replace account scoping in database queries.

Request ordering values must be allowlisted before they reach `order`:

```ruby
def index
  allowed_columns = %w[id subject created_at]
  allowed_directions = %w[asc desc]

  column = query.dig(:order, :by).to_s
  direction = query.dig(:order, :dir).to_s.downcase

  column = "id" unless allowed_columns.include?(column)
  direction = "desc" unless allowed_directions.include?(direction)

  current_user.account.my_engine.tickets.order(column => direction)
end
```

---

## Find and Result Contract

The base `find` method accepts a resource, stores it, and returns the service object:

```ruby
def find(id:)
  ticket = current_user.account.my_engine.tickets.find_by(id: id)
  super(ticket)
end
```

The controller can then use the service contract:

```ruby
ticket = TicketService.new(current_user, query).find(id: params[:id])
return respond_with_not_found unless ticket.found?

@ticket = ticket.result
```

`found?` checks whether the stored resource is present, and `result` returns that resource.

---

## Mutations and Failures

Mutation methods should return `self` so callers can inspect `successful?`, `result`, and `errors`:

```ruby
def create(attributes)
  ticket = current_user.account.my_engine.tickets.new(attributes)

  if ticket.save
    self.resource = ticket
  else
    error(ticket.errors.full_messages.to_sentence)
  end

  self
end
```

The base class provides:

| Method | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `successful?` | Returns `true` when no failures have been registered |
| `error(message)` | Appends a failure message |
| `errors` | Returns all registered failures |
| `errors_as_sentence` | Joins failures into one sentence |
| `result` | Returns the stored resource |
| `found?` | Reports whether a stored resource is present |

The base implementations of `list`, `index`, `show`, `update`, and `delete` are extension points and do not perform database operations. Implement the methods the service needs.

---

## Cache Keys

Services can build account- or user-scoped cache keys:

```ruby
cache_key_for_account(:index)
cache_key_for_user(:profile)
```

The generated key contains the scope, account or user ID, service class, optional method name, and `query[:cacheKey]` when provided.

These helpers require a current user with the corresponding account context. Treat a client-provided `cacheKey` as a cache variant, not as authorization or tenant identity.

---

## Controller Integration

A typical controller keeps orchestration at the boundary and delegates persistence to the service:

```ruby
def create
  ticket = TicketService.new(current_user, query).create(ticket_params)

  if ticket.successful?
    respond_with_lesli(
      turbo: stream_redirection(ticket_path(ticket.result)),
      json: ticket.result
    )
  else
    respond_with_lesli(
      turbo: stream_notification_danger(ticket.errors_as_sentence),
      json: { errors: ticket.errors }
    )
  end
end
```

Keep HTTP rendering in controllers and business failures in services.
