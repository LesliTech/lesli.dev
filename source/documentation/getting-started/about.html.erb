<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>

<p>The text &quot;Ruby on Rails SaaS development platform&quot; describes a software development platform that utilizes the Ruby on Rails framework to build Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails, often referred to as Rails, is a popular open-source web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing developers with a structured and efficient way to build web applications.</p>

<p>In the context of SaaS development, the platform leverages Ruby on Rails to create scalable and customizable software solutions that can be accessed by users over the internet. SaaS refers to a software delivery model where applications are centrally hosted and provided as a service to customers. This eliminates the need for users to install and maintain software locally, as they can access the application through a web browser.</p>

<p>By utilizing Ruby on Rails as the underlying framework, the SaaS development platform benefits from its extensive libraries, conventions, and built-in features. Rails simplifies common web development tasks, such as routing, database management, and handling user authentication, enabling developers to focus on building the core functionalities of their SaaS applications efficiently.</p>
