                <h1>Pull requests</h1>

<h3>Pull requests are for humans</h3>

<p>Remember to review other people&#39;s code just ike you would like to your code be reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>Be kind:</strong> Any improvement or change you think can be made in the reviewing code, try to write a message (or review) with touch, care and empathy.</p>

<p><strong>Be clear:</strong> Make it easy for the developer understand your feedback, avoid any workaround and write down only your comments/suggestions of the code you are reviewing.</p>

<p><strong>Be specific:</strong> Write as many messages as needed and select directly the line of code where your suggestion starts. Try to avoid general feedback, not try to cover so much in a single sentence.</p>

<h3>Give clear suggestions and recommendations</h3>

<p>Do not write that code needs to be fixed or can be improved without giving suggestions or recommendations on what to fix or how to fix it, also, a brief explanation is always welcome.</p>

<h3>Always assume good intent</h3>

<p>Code may not be written how you would write it. Let’s say that more clearly: code is rarely written the same way by two different people. After all, code is a craft, not a task on an assembly line.</p>

<p>Tap into a sense of curiosity and appreciation while reviewing – curiosity to understand what the reviewer had in mind and gratitude for what the developer did or tried to do.</p>

<h3>Clarify the action and the level of importance.</h3>

<p>If you are making an optional suggestion, for example, a “nit” that isn&#39;t necessary before the code is approved for production, say so clearly. </p>

<p>If you wonder why the person made a particular choice, but it doesn’t affect whether the code should make it to production, say so clearly. </p>

<p>If you are confident that the code needs to be fixed before it is ready for production, say so clearly. </p>

<h3>Don&#39;t forget that all feedback can include praise.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to say that the key benefit of doing code reviews is to make the code better and fix issues. <br>
But that&#39;s only half of it. On the flip side, code reviews present an excellent opportunity to thank you and appreciate your colleagues&#39; work. <br>
If someone has written particularly elegant or maintainable code or has made a great decision about using a library, let them know!</p>

<h2>What to review</h2>

<p>The code review is always up to the point of view of the developer that is reviewing, and there are no specif or hard rules about what the developers have to check to aprove or deny a pull request.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions about we can review: </p>

<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> license at the begining of every code file, brief description for every method.<br>
<strong>Use of correct responders:</strong> like respond<em>with</em>successful or respond<em>with</em>pagination.<br>
<strong>Inherit from the correct CloudObjects:</strong> ApplicationLesliResponder, ApplicationLesliRecord, etc.<br>
<strong>Use of the correct tools for an specific tasks:</strong> Date2 for date parsing, etc.</p>

<h2>What a pull requests must include</h2>

<ul>
<li>Complete set of tests for the controller, model or api that the pull requests is about.</li>
<li>Clear and brief list of changes. (Use the description of the PR)</li>
</ul>
